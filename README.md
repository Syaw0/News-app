# NEWS APP

</br>

## How I worked on this project

First, I implemented the basic plans from a general plan that came to my mind, and of course, combined with a design on the Internet, including the Home  part , News Detail and News List.
Then I implemented the news information on the template with a  practical API , but this project also had some problems, which I will tell you below.
