            Judi Love clearly had a cracking night at the TV Baftas, as she turned up to Loose Women seeming…a little worse for wear. We love this for her. Of course, Judi looked as gorge as ever, but seemed less than her lively self as she was filmed making her way into the ITV studio to present the daytime show after spending much of the night at Mo Gilligan’s after party, after he scooped up an award. Ruth Langsford spilled the beans, with footage of Judi arriving at the studio being shown. Rocking all-black and some very essential shades to block out the light, Judi wandered into the studio with a bag slung over her shoulder – before almost falling back into the door. Sounding rather raspy, Judi said: ‘Morning, I’m fine!’ with someone off-camera heard responding: ‘Jesus, Judy!’ The ladies giggled as they looked on at the footage, with Ruth saying: ‘She falls down [onto the sofa] really’. Judi didn’t quite look her usual self (Picture: ITV) After Ruth suggested Judi might be feeling ‘delicate’, the presenter responded: ‘I learned from you guys, as professionals, the show must go on. ‘I’m ready and I’m not going to move too much because my head might be a little woohoo!’ We can’t blame her in the slightest! At the prestigious night, Jodie Comer and Sean Bean led the winners, with shows like Gogglebox, Saturday Night Takeaway, and Coronation Street also picking up awards. An absolute icon (Picture: ITV) Big Zuu had a huge night after winning in two categories – features and entertainment performance. Aside from the wins and losses, we also witnessed some pretty iconic moments – we got the first interviews from Sex Education star Ncuti Gatwa, who’s been announced as the 14th Doctor, taking over from Jodie Whittaker this autumn. The actor beamed as he posed with returning showrunner Russell T Davies, before promising that he won’t be dishing out any spoilers. Judi looked sensational on the big night (Picture: WireImage) He later received a huge round of applause when he took to the stage to present the award for scripted comedy (which went to Motherland). Meanwhile, Lorraine Kelly couldn’t resist making a dig at Boris Johnson, who recently asked who the daytime TV legend was in his explosive interview with Susanna Reid. While presenting the award for news coverage (which went to ITV News’ coverage of the Storming of the Capitol) she quipped: ‘Hello and a special hello to Boris, I’m Lorraine, lovely to see you’.
